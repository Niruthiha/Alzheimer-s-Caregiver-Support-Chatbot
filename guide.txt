Late-Stage Caregiving
The late stage of Alzheimer's disease may last from several weeks to several years. As the disease progresses, intensive, around-the-clock care is usually required.

What to expect:
- Difficulty eating and swallowing
- Assistance with walking, eventually becoming unable to walk
- Full-time help with personal care
- Vulnerability to infections, especially pneumonia

Your role as caregiver:
During the late stages, your role focuses on preserving quality of life and dignity. Although communication becomes challenging, the person's core self may still be present. You can connect through senses like touch, sound, sight, taste, and smell.

Late-stage care options:
Since care needs are extensive, they may exceed what you can provide at home, even with additional assistance. Consider moving the person into a facility for specialized care. Deciding on late-stage care can be difficult, but gathering information and moving forward is crucial.

Hospice is another option focused on quality and dignity at the end of life. It provides comfort, care, and support services. Discuss end-of-life care wishes early on if possible.
